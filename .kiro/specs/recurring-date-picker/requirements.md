# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The recurring date picker component is a reusable React component that allows users to select and configure recurring dates with various patterns and customization options. Similar to scheduling features found in applications like TickTick, this component provides an intuitive interface for setting up complex recurring date patterns with visual preview capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select basic recurring patterns, so that I can quickly set up common recurring schedules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the recurring date picker THEN the system SHALL display options for Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Yearly recurrence patterns
2. WHEN the user selects a basic pattern THEN the system SHALL apply the default configuration for that pattern
3. WHEN the user selects Daily THEN the system SHALL configure recurrence for every day
4. WHEN the user selects Weekly THEN the system SHALL configure recurrence for the same day each week
5. WHEN the user selects Monthly THEN the system SHALL configure recurrence for the same date each month
6. WHEN the user selects Yearly THEN the system SHALL configure recurrence for the same date each year

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to customize recurring intervals, so that I can create patterns like "every 2 weeks" or "every 3 months".

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects a recurring pattern THEN the system SHALL provide an input field to specify the interval (every X days/weeks/months/years)
2. WHEN the user enters a custom interval THEN the system SHALL validate that the interval is a positive integer
3. WHEN the user sets "every 2 weeks" THEN the system SHALL generate dates occurring every 14 days from the start date
4. WHEN the user sets "every 3 months" THEN the system SHALL generate dates occurring every 3 months from the start date
5. IF the interval is invalid THEN the system SHALL display an error message and prevent submission

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to select specific days of the week for weekly recurrence, so that I can create patterns like "every Monday and Wednesday".

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects weekly recurrence THEN the system SHALL display checkboxes for each day of the week
2. WHEN the user checks specific days THEN the system SHALL only generate recurring dates for those selected days
3. WHEN no days are selected THEN the system SHALL display a validation error
4. WHEN multiple days are selected THEN the system SHALL generate dates for all selected days within each week interval

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create complex monthly patterns, so that I can set up schedules like "the second Tuesday of every month".

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user selects monthly recurrence THEN the system SHALL provide options for "same date each month" or "specific day pattern"
2. WHEN the user selects "specific day pattern" THEN the system SHALL display dropdowns for ordinal position (first, second, third, fourth, last) and day of week
3. WHEN the user selects "second Tuesday" THEN the system SHALL generate dates for the second Tuesday of each month
4. WHEN the selected pattern doesn't exist in a month THEN the system SHALL skip that month
5. WHEN the user selects "last Friday" THEN the system SHALL generate dates for the last Friday of each month

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to set a date range for my recurring pattern, so that I can control when the recurrence starts and optionally when it ends.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user opens the date picker THEN the system SHALL require a start date selection
2. WHEN the user selects a start date THEN the system SHALL use this as the first occurrence of the recurring pattern
3. WHEN the user wants to set an end date THEN the system SHALL provide an optional end date field
4. WHEN an end date is set THEN the system SHALL only generate recurring dates up to and including the end date
5. IF the end date is before the start date THEN the system SHALL display a validation error
6. WHEN no end date is set THEN the system SHALL generate recurring dates indefinitely (with reasonable preview limits)

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a visual preview of my selected recurring dates, so that I can verify the pattern is correct before confirming.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user configures any recurring pattern THEN the system SHALL display a mini calendar preview
2. WHEN recurring dates are generated THEN the system SHALL highlight these dates in the preview calendar
3. WHEN the user changes the recurring configuration THEN the system SHALL update the preview calendar in real-time
4. WHEN there are many recurring dates THEN the system SHALL show at least the next 12 occurrences in the preview
5. WHEN the user hovers over a highlighted date THEN the system SHALL display the date information

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the component to be reusable and well-structured, so that it can be easily integrated into different applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the component THEN the system SHALL be broken down into smaller, reusable sub-components
2. WHEN the component is used THEN it SHALL accept props for configuration and callbacks
3. WHEN the component state changes THEN it SHALL notify parent components through callback functions
4. WHEN the component is styled THEN it SHALL use Tailwind CSS or a configurable CSS framework
5. WHEN the component is imported THEN it SHALL have clear TypeScript interfaces for all props and return values

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive testing coverage, so that the component is reliable and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are written THEN they SHALL cover all key logic components including date generation algorithms
2. WHEN integration tests are written THEN they SHALL test the complete component workflow from user input to date generation
3. WHEN tests are run THEN they SHALL validate edge cases like leap years, month boundaries, and invalid inputs
4. WHEN the component is tested THEN it SHALL include tests for user interactions and state management
5. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL achieve at least 80% code coverage
